<h1> My Trip to Thailand!</h1>

<h2> I will be going over how I spent my 2 weeks in Thailand </h2>
<br>

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p> During my trip to Thailand, I visited many beautiful places and got to experience Thai culture like local foods, muay thai, temples etc.
    I will be sharing some of my pictures and what area I visited during my trip. Me and my friends planned
    this trip for 2 weeks which was perfect amount of time to explore the country. We visited Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Krabi.
    Each place had its own unique vibe and culture.

<h4>Bangkok</h4>

<p> Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand and is known for its vibrant street life, cultural landmarks, and markets. This city
    reminded me of Vegas and New York because of tall buildings, nightlife and busy streets. Here is the list of places/activies I visited in Bangkok:
    <ul>
        <li>Grand Palace</li>
        <li>Wat Arun</li>
        <li>Khao San Road</li>
        <li>Chatuchak Weekend Market</li>
        <li>Boat Ride on Chao Phraya River</li>
        <li>Muy Thai fight</li>
    </ul>
